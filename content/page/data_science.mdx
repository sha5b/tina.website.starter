          Geoinformation systems (GIS) and systematic data analytics are part of
          the rapid&#x20;

          technological progress. By designing and implementing spatial data
          infrastructures and data&#x20;

          interfaces, we enable our clients to implement networked and
          end-to-end digital processes&#x20;

          and data flows to optimise workflows, logistics and productivity, to
          promote the quality of&#x20;

          collaboration and communication and to manage tasks quickly and
          efficiently.
